# 🚀 Deploy Your App Now - 3 Simple Steps

## Everything is Ready!

Your code is prepared for deployment. Here's what to do:

---

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository (2 minutes)

1. **Go to:** https://github.com
2. **Sign in** (or create free account if needed)
3. **Click:** The **"+"** icon (top right) → **"New repository"**
4. **Repository name:** `time-use-survey-2022` (or any name you like)
5. **Make it PUBLIC** ✅ (required for free Streamlit Cloud)
6. **IMPORTANT:** Do NOT check any boxes (no README, .gitignore, license)
7. **Click:** "Create repository"

**After creating, GitHub will show you a URL like:**
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/time-use-survey-2022.git
```

---

## Step 2: Push Code to GitHub

**Tell me your GitHub username and I'll help you push the code!**

Or run these commands yourself (replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username):

```bash
# Commit all files
git commit -m "Initial commit - Time Use Survey 2022 Application"

# Set main branch
git branch -M main

# Connect to your GitHub repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/time-use-survey-2022.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

**If you get authentication errors:**
- GitHub requires a Personal Access Token (not password)
- Create one at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
- Click "Generate new token (classic)"
- Select scope: `repo` (full control)
- Use the token as your password when pushing

---

## Step 3: Deploy to Streamlit Cloud (1 minute)

1. **Go to:** https://share.streamlit.io
2. **Sign in** with your GitHub account
3. **Click:** "New app"
4. **Fill in:**
   - Repository: `YOUR_USERNAME/time-use-survey-2022`
   - Branch: `main`
   - Main file path: `app.py`
   - App URL (optional): Choose something like `time-use-survey-2022`
5. **Click:** "Deploy"

**Wait 2-5 minutes** and your app will be live! 🎉

---

## Your App Will Be Live At:

```
https://time-use-survey-2022.streamlit.app
```
(Or whatever URL you chose)

---

## What I Need From You:

**Just tell me:**
1. **Your GitHub username:** _______________
2. **The repository name you created:** _______________

**Then I'll help you:**
- Push the code to GitHub
- Set up Git LFS if data files are large
- Deploy to Streamlit Cloud
- Get your live URL!
